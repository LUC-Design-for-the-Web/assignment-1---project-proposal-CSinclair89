        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>I want my website to be a portfolio of my creative work over the years, including the website design itself.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Goal #1: To be easy to navigate between categories such as 
                music, animation, video games, dance, portfolio, resume, contact, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Goal #2: For the end result of the website to <em>also</em> showcase quality web design abilities. 
                I want to cover the bases of accessibility with color scheme and alt text. 
                I also want to make custom-animated CSS buttons (which I know are advanced), possibly sub-menus,  and -- 
                it's a stretch -- but maybe make some kind of forms so I can later work on back-end development with Java.
            </li>  
            <li>
                Goal #3: I would like my website to be a good window into my interests, hobbies, and my general personality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Site Example</h2>
        <a href = "https://billburr.com">
        <img class = "example" src = "/img/billburr.png" alt = "Comedian Bill Burr"></a>
        <p>I chose Bill Burr's website because I think it is a strikingly simple layout that covers a lot of ground.
        He has all of the necessary navigation to his content at the top, including his podcast and videos of his
        performances. On top of that, the social media links are on the top right. You can also scroll down to see more
        content, hear an embedded player set to the latest episode of his podcast, as well as contact info for bookings.</p>
        <p>There is also subtle CSS work that I noticed on the page that I would be interested in learning about
        and even expanding upon for my own site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Since this is essentially an art-based website, I suppose the target audience would be other artists. 
        Whether it's musicians, animators, or people that like video games, this is generally a website 
        geared towards that kind of crowd.</p>
